# Project goal
It's frustrating when I come home hoping to relax, only to find unexpected guests. The goal is to monitoring network activity on my home router and sends notifications to me through Telegram bot whenever a new device (station) connects or disconnects. I receving logs from my router through udp stream. This will help me stay informed about who is present in my home before I arrive. I've assigned static IP addresses to my family members' devices from my router's DHCP server to identify any unknown devices.
