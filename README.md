# Project goal
I find it annoying when I come home expecting peace and quiet, but then discover unexpected guests. The goal is to monitoring network activity on my home router and sends notifications to me through Telegram bot whenever a new device (station) connects or disconnects. I receive logs from my router through udp stream. This will help me stay informed about who is present in my home before I arrive. I've assigned static IP addresses to my family members' devices from my router's DHCP server to identify any unknown devices.
